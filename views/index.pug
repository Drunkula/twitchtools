				h2 New Chatter List
				h3 it's super attentive
			.block The first time one of your viewers chats their name will be added to a list, letting you know who's around without having to scroll through the chat history.
			.block This tool will let you easily spot a chatter that might get buried under chat between your regulars or who's joined since you did a BRB.

				h2 Chat Alerts
				h3 Don't miss out
			.block If you don't check on the chat because you're caught up in your game or you're a smaller channel not used to getting many messages then this tool can alert you by flashing the browser or playing a sound (your choice).  Cooldowns mean you won't get alerts for every message and you can set timeouts any time at the click of a button.

				h2 You're muted!
				h3 Ding ding!
			.block Alerts you when people say you're muted by flashing the browser or playing a sound.
			.block You can limit it to mods, vips or named chatters and cooldowns will automatically trigger, or be extended with the click of a button.

				h2 Known Chatters
				h3 good and bad
			.block VIPs, named people or 'wrong uns' enter the chat - you get told
			.block I'm considering a community driven <em>wrong 'un</em> list.  You'd be notified by the tool as soon as they joined the channel even before they sent any messages with tags on why they'd been reported.

				h2 OBS Control via chat
				h3 Mod helpers
			.block Custom chat commands will let mods, vips or named chatters change scenes (you left it on BRB again!) or even unmute your mic.
			.block A little more complicated than the other tools as you'll need to install OBS Websockets - which you might already be using if if you're using tools like Touch Portal or Lioranboard.
			.block !gamescene !brb !unmute, etc... you get the idea.

				h2 OBS Remote Control Panel
				h3 Mod like a boss
			.block Easily set up a remote control panel that'll allow a mod to select scenes, mute and unmute your mic, etc.  As with the chat commands if you've left yourself muted and on the BRB screen then mods can save the day.
			.block After you've created a panel you can send a link to the panel page that'll be valid only for 6 hours, or you can enable panels for longer and revoke its use as any time.

				h2 A Bonus
				h3 That's nice
			.block Most tools this can be added as a custom dock in OBS so they'll always be ready.
			.block If you can't see OBS while gaming then chat commands like !muted cooldown 5 or !newchatter disable will let you or your mods stop things from getting really annoying.

		.column.is-6.section.is-small
			header
				h2.is-italic Where are the rest of the tools?
				h3 Gimme nawww!
			.block I've already implemented most of them but I want to tart them up for the website and create micro-versions for using in OBS custom docks.  And I'll have to make this entire thing look like less of a mess.

		.column.is-6.section.is-small

				h2 Security
				h3 who's listening?
			.block All of these tools bar one (mod remote panel, or if the community blacklist happens) will work directly from whatever browser you choose running entirely locally in javascript with zero communication to this site.  This means you can download all or any of the tools and use them locally.  You won't even need a local web server.  You can edit the config files to add the channel(s) to load by default and set preferences on who can use use custom commands.

			.block All tools can be limited to just your use as broadcaster or extend them with checkboxes to mods, vips or everyone.  Use can even be limited to those named only where appropriate.
